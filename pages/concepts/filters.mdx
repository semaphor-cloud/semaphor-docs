## Filtering Cards

### Overview

Semaphor supports two types of filters: **On-click filter** and **Top-level filter**.

The **On-click** filter is activated when a user clicks on an element in a chart, such as a bar in a bar chart. By default, the on-click filter passes the `X-axis` field/value (and `Y-axis` for vertical orientation) to all the subscribing cards. On-click filter is ideal for progressive filtering and drill-downs. You have the option to enable or disable this interaction in the explorer view.

The **Top-Level filters**, as the name suggests, are located at the top of the dashboard. They are best suited for continuous data types, such as dates and numbers.

You can set up a filter subscription on the card query using the handle-bar syntax `{{ }}`. Currently, we offer two filter functions, `{{ filters | where }}` and `{{ filters | and }}` as a shorthand for the `WHERE` and `AND` clauses, respectively.

As an example, the query below represents a card SQL which counts orders by cities.

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
{{ filters | where }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

When the user applies the filters either by clicking on a chart element or selecting a value in the top-level filter, the query is resolved as follows.

```sql {2} filename="Filter SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city = 'Albuquerque' AND discount IN (0.2)
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

Note that `{{ filters | where }}` function is replaced by a `WHERE` clause, which performs `AND` operation on the incoming `city` and `discount` filter values. You can use this filter when your card SQL **does not** contain a `WHERE` clause.

However, if your base query already contains a `WHERE` clause as shown below, you can use the `{{ filters | and }}` function to append the incoming filter values to the existing `WHERE` clause.

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city = 'Albuquerque' {{ filters | and }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

When the user selects 20% `discount` from the top-level filter, the card SQL resolves as following:

```sql {2} filename="Filter SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city = 'Albuquerque' AND discount IN (0.2)
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

Note that the `discount` filter value is appended to the existing `WHERE` clause.

Semphor represents the filter array as shown below. You can view the active filters by clicking on the filter icon on the top right side of the query editor. We can use the following fitler array as an example to illustrate more fitlering scenarios.

```json
[
  {
    "filterId": "238861f3-9721-4217-bea7-5778387b1095",
    "name": "city",
    "operation": "in",
    "values": [
      "Albuquerque",
      "Alexandria",
    ]
  },
  {
    "filterId": "040ab3de-b2b4-4c0b-9871-0a4d21ceee42",
    "name": "segment",
    "operation": "in",
    "values": [
      "Corporate"
    ]
  }
  {
    "filterId": "0345ab3de-b2b4-4c0b-9871-0a4d21ceee35",
    "name": "discount",
    "operation": ">",
    "values": ["0.2"]
  }
]
```

### Specific Fields

If you want filter a card only for specific fields, you can reference the field value using this syntax `{{ filters['field']| where }}`. For instance, if you want to filter the card only by discount, your card query would look like this:

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
{{ filters['discount']| where }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

Now, when the user fitlers by `discount` the card query resolves as below:

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE discount > 0.2
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

Note how this query ignores other `segment` and `city` columns.

When doing joins, you may need to pass in the appropriate table aliases for specific fields. Here's how you can do that:

```sql
SELECT city, COUNT(*)
FROM sales_data
{{ filters['discount'] | where('>', table_alias='c') }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

Now, when the user fitlers by `discount` the card query resolves as below:

```sql {2} filename="Filter SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE c.discount > 0.2
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

### Excluding Fields

In situations where you need to subscribe to all the filter fields except for specific ones, you can provide a comma-separated list in the array, as shown below. For example, the below card query subscribes to all filter fields except `discount`.

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*)
FROM sales_data {{ filters | where(exclude=['discount']) }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

This will resolve to the following query. Note that `discount` field is absent from the `WHERE` clause.

```sql {2} filename="Filter SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city IN ('Albuquerque', 'Alexandria') AND segment IN ('Corporate')
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

### API Filters

You can also use the handle-bar notation to modify your API connection. For example, the below URL:

```markdown filename="API Connection"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/{{ filters['id']['values'][0] }}
```

would resolve to

```markdown filename="Filtered API"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2
```

Now, if you want to provide a default value when no filter is present, you can use the following expression:

```markdown filename="API Connection"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/{{ filters.get('id', {}).get('values', [1])[0] }}
```

This resolves to

```markdown filename="Filtered API"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
```

Notice that `todos/1` is the default value.

### Disable Filtering

To prevent a card from filtering, specify `{{ no_filters }}` annotation in the card query. This will unsubscribe the card from the incoming filters.
