## Filtering Cards

### Overview

Semaphor supports two types of filters: **On-click Filter** and **Top-level Filter**.

The On-click filter is applied when a user clicks a chart element, such as a bar in a bar chart. By default, the on-click action filters by `X-axis` field/value (and `Y-axis` for vertical orientation) for subscribing cards. This filter type is ideal for cross-card filtering and drill-downs. You have the option to enable or disable this interaction in the explorer view.

The Top-Level filter is defined at the top of the dashboard. It becomes a part of your dashboard definition. It is best suited for filtering by continuous data types, such as dates and numbers.

You can set up a filter subscription for your cards using a handlebar syntax `{{ }}`. Currently, we offer two filter functions, `{{ filters | where }}` and `{{ filters | and }}` as a shorthand for the `WHERE` and `AND` clauses.

For instance, the card SQL below `counts orders by cities`.

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
{{ filters | where }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

You can pass this filter either by clicking the chart element or selecting a value in the top-level filter. Semaphor resolves this query as below:

```sql {2} filename="Resolved Query"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city = 'Albuquerque' AND discount IN (0.2)
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

Notice that `{{ filters | where }}` function is replaced by a `WHERE` clause, which performs `AND` operation on the incoming `city` and `discount` filter values. You can use this filter when your card SQL **DOES NOT** already contain a `WHERE` clause.

However, if your query already contains a `WHERE` clause, you can use the `{{ filters | and }}` function to append the incoming filter values to the existing `WHERE` clause.

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city = 'Albuquerque' {{ filters | and }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

Now, when the user selects `20%` `discount` from the top-level filter, the query resolves as the following:

```sql {2} filename="Resolved Query"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city = 'Albuquerque' AND discount IN (0.2)
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

Note that the `discount` field is appended to the existing `WHERE` clause.

Internally, Semaphor represents filters as shown below. You can view the active filters by clicking on the filter icon on the top right side of the query editor. We will use the following fitler array as an example to illustrate how to further finetune your filters.

```json
[
  {
    "filterId": "238861f3-9721-4217-bea7-5778387b1095",
    "name": "city",
    "operation": "in",
    "values": [
      "Albuquerque",
      "Alexandria",
    ]
  },
  {
    "filterId": "040ab3de-b2b4-4c0b-9871-0a4d21ceee42",
    "name": "segment",
    "operation": "in",
    "values": [
      "Corporate"
    ]
  }
  {
    "filterId": "0345ab3de-b2b4-4c0b-9871-0a4d21ceee35",
    "name": "discount",
    "operation": ">",
    "values": ["0.2"]
  }
]
```

### Filtering by specific fields

If you only want to filter by specific fields, you can reference the field value like `{{ filters['field']| where }}`. For instance, if you want the card to only filter when `discount` field is passed, you can structure your query like this:

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
{{ filters['discount']| where }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

Semaphor resolves this query as below omitting `segment` and `city` columns.

```sql {2} filename="Resolved Query"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE discount > 0.2
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50

```

While doing joins, you may need to pass in the appropriate table aliases for specific fields when there is field overlap between the tables. Here's how you can do that:

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
{{ filters['discount'] | where('>', table_alias='c') }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

Now, when the user fitlers by `discount` the query resolves as below:

```sql {2} filename="Resolved Query"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE c.discount > 0.2
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

---

### Excluding Fields

You many also have a use case where you need to subscribe to all filters except for specific fields. Ycan provide a comma-separated exclusion list. The below card SQL subscribes to all filter fields except `discount`.

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT city, COUNT(*)
FROM sales_data {{ filters | where(exclude=['discount']) }}
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

The above query resolves as follows. Note that `discount` field is absent from the `WHERE` clause.

```sql {2} filename="Resolved Query"
SELECT city, COUNT(*) FROM sales_data
WHERE city IN ('Albuquerque', 'Alexandria') AND segment IN ('Corporate')
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city DESC LIMIT 50
```

### Disable Filtering

To disable filtering, annotate your card query with `{{ no_filters }}`. This will unsubscribe the card from all incoming filters.

---

### API Filters

When using an API connection, you can use the filters in the SQL query as described above. However, you can also use handlebar notation to pass query parameters or replace certain parts of the URL based on the user filters. For example, consider the following API where you want to fetch the status of a todo ID based on the filter value.

```markdown filename="API Connection"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/{{ filters['id']['values'][0] }}
```

If the user selects 2 from top-level filter, the expression would resolve to:

```markdown filename="Filtered API"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2
```

Now, if you want to provide a default value when no filter is present, you can use the following expression:

```markdown filename="API Connection"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/{{ filters.get('id', {}).get('values', [1])[0] }}
```

`.get('values', [1])[0]` part of the expression applies the default value condition, and the expression resolves to:

```markdown filename="Filtered API"
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
```

Notice that `todos/1` is the default value.

## Loading dashboard with filters

When you load a dashboard with filters, Semaphor will automatically apply the filters to the cards that are subscribed to the filter fields.

You can copy the filter values array by clicking on the filter icon from the console as shown below:

![CLS](pages/concepts/filter-images/filter-values-array.png)

Now you can use this array to load the dashboard with the default filters applied.

```jsx
import { useDashboardActions, Dashboard } from 'semaphor';

const { setFilterValues } = useDashboardActions();

const defaultFilterValues: TFilterValue[] = [
  {
    filterId: '492ca81f-2a85-4fdd-99c7-633ada500da2',
    connectionType: 'database',
    name: 'sales_data.category',
    valueType: 'string',
    operation: 'in',
    values: ['Furniture'],
  },
];

<Dashboard
  onFilterValuesChange={handleFilterValuesChange}
  defaultFilterValues={defaultFilterValues}
/>;
```

The `onFilterValuesChange` prop is a callback function that is called when the user changes the filter values. You can use this callback to update the `defaultFilterValues` prop and re-render the dashboard with the new filters applied.

If you don't want to reload the entire dashboard when the filter values change, you can use the `setFilterValues` function to update the filter values. This will apply the the new filters within the same dashboard session.
