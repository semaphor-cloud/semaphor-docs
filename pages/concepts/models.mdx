## Base Queries / Data Models

The `base queries` serve as the top-level data model that you can reference in your card SQL. It promotes the reusability of SQL logic across all dashboard cards. They come handy in scenarios where you want to create multiple visualizations from the same underlying dataset. You can represent this dataset using a `base query` and reference it in all your dashboard cards as `{{ ref('base_query') }}`.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout  emoji="⚠️">
  The [filters](/concepts/filters) must be located within the same SQL block where the database tables are referenced. Filters placed outside could lead to errors. 
</Callout

>

You can create a `base query` from the card explorer as shown below.

In this example, we create a CTE (Common Table Txpresssion) and place our filter `{{ filters | and }}` as shown below. The `base query` represents the top-level data model that you want to visualize. This can be a single table or a result of join between multiple tables.

```sql {3} filename="Base Query"
WITH subquery AS
    ( SELECT * FROM sales_data
      WHERE segment = 'Consumer' {{ filters | and }}
    )
    select * from subquery
```

After defining the `base query`, you can reference it in your card SQL as shown below.

```sql {2} filename="Card SQL"
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM {{ ref('consumer_segment') }}
GROUP BY category ORDER BY category DESC LIMIT 100
```

Notice that that card SQL does not have any filters. The filters must be passed to the base query where tables are referenced.
