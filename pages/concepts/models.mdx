## Base Queries / Data Models

The `base queries` serve as the top-level data model that you can reference in your card SQL. It promotes the reusability of SQL logic across all dashboard cards. They come handy in scenarios where you want to create multiple visualizations from the same underlying dataset. You can represent this dataset using a `base query` and reference it in all your dashboard cards as `{{ ref('base_query') }}`.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout  emoji="⚠️">
  The [filters](/concepts/filters) must be located within the same SQL block where the database tables are referenced. Filters placed outside could lead to errors. 
</Callout

You can create a `base query` from the card explorer as shown below.

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  The name of the `base_query` should be unique and must not match the name of
  any inner tables within the query. This ensures that there are no conflicts or
  ambiguities between the `base_query` and the tables it references.
</Callout>

In this example, we create a CTE (Common Table Txpresssion) and place our filter `{{ filters | and }}` as shown below. The `base query` represents the top-level data model that you want to visualize. This can be a single table or a result of join between multiple tables.

```sql {3} filename="Base Query"
WITH consumer_segment AS
    ( SELECT * FROM sales_data
      WHERE segment = 'Consumer' {{ filters | and }}
    )
    select * from consumer_segment
```

After defining the `base query`, you can reference it in your card SQL as shown below.

```sql {2} filename="Resolved Query"
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM {{ ref('consumer_segment_bq') }}
GROUP BY category ORDER BY category DESC LIMIT 100
```

Notice that that card SQL does not have any filters. The filters must be passed to the base query where tables are referenced.
