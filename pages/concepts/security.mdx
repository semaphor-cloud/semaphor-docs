## Security & Multi-tenancy

Semaphor offers multiple options for securing and segmenting customer data based on your tenant. You can use `connection-level`, `table-level`, and `row/column-level` security policies within Semaphor to precisely control what your users see when they log into your app.

### Connection-Level Security

Connection-level policies provide strict data isolation between your tenants by connecting to dedicated databases or folders at run time. With connection-level polices, you can parameterize parts of your database strings and file paths depending on the requesting tenant. This approach eliminates dashboard duplication, and allows you to deliver the same dashboard to multiple clients in a secure manner.

Here is how it works: When a user is authenticated by your app, based on the user's tenancy and profile, you pass in the appropriate `parameter` along with your `dashboard id` and `secret`. Semaphor then uses the this `parameter` to generate the auth token that can only access the data authorized to that user.

In Semaphor, you can visualize `.csv` or `.parquet` files from Amazon S3. Refer to the [S3 connection](http://docs.semaphor.cloud/connections#amazon-s3) section for instructions. After establishing the connection, set up a connection policy in your project. This policy defines the parameters to adjust the file path based on the tenant.

A common pattern here is folder-based tenant segmentation, where the data for each client is stored in dedicated folders. In this example, we store data for each tenant in their respective prefixes (tenant_a, tenant_b, etc.) as shown below:

```
s3://semaphor-private/store/tenant_a/sales.parquet
s3://semaphor-private/store/tenant_b/sales.parquet
...
s3://semaphor-private/store/tenant_n/sales.parquet

```

To switch the file path based on the tenant, you can create a policy with a `tenant` parameter. You can also have more than one parameter within the policy.

`s3://semaphor-private/store/{{ tenant }}/sales.parquet`

In Semaphor, you can connect to any SQL compatible databases. Refer to the [connection section](https://docs.semaphor.cloud/connections) for instructions. After establishing the connection, you can set up a connection policy in your project that defines how to modify the database connection based on the tenant. To apply this policy to the dashboard, you need to provide the values for the parameters when requesting the auth token.

A common pattern would be a seperate database for each client or for a set of clients, like so:

```
postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@host:port/tenant_a
postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@host:port/tenant_b
...
postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@host:port/tenant_n
```

For this setup, you can create a connection policy with a tenant parameter. You can also have more than one parameter within the policy.

`postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@host:port/{{ tenant }}`

  </Tabs.Tab>

Now you can apply this policy to your dashboard. When you authenticate the user on the server side, based on their tenacy and profile, you can consturct a connection policy object as shown below. Pass this object along with the dashboard ID and secret to the token API.

```ts {5-10, 22} filename="server-side.ts"
// Do the server side user authentication above and resolve the tenant param

const tenant = 'tenant_a'; // example

const connectionPolicy = {
  name: 'store_sales_primary',
  params: {
    tenant: tenant,
  },
};

async function fetchToken() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(TOKEN_URL, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        dashboardId: DASHBOARD_ID,
        dashboardSecret: DASHBOARD_SECRET,
        cls: tenant ? [connectionPolicy] : [],
      }),
    });
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const token = await response.json();
    if (token?.accessToken) {
      setAuthToken(token);
      console.log('Token:', token);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('There was an error!', error);
  }
}

fetchToken();
```

### Row/Column-Level Security

Row/Column-Level policies are particularly useful when all customer data resides in a single database table or a set of files that you need to logically segment based on the tenant. These policies act like row filters or `WHERE` clauses on your tables.

Here's how it works: When a user is authenticated by your app, depending on their tenancy and profile, you pass the appropriate `parameter` for that policy, along with your `dashboard id` and `secret`. Semaphor then uses the `parameter` to generate a `token` that is scoped to the data authorized for that user.

The screenshot below defines the row/column-level policy. This policy expects a `state` parameter in the SQL expression. Additionally, it denies the access to the `discount` column.

`state in {{ state }}`

![rcls](pages/concepts/security_images/rcls.png)

After authenticating the user, you can pass in the `state` values depending on the user's profile.

```ts {5-10, 22} filename="server-side.ts"
// Do the server side user authentication above and resolve the `state` parameter.

const rowPolicy = {
  name: 'state',
  params: {
    state: ['California', 'Nevada', 'Washington'],
  },
};

async function fetchToken() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(TOKEN_URL, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        dashboardId: DASHBOARD_ID,
        dashboardSecret: DASHBOARD_SECRET,
        rcls: rowPolicy,
      }),
    });
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const token = await response.json();
    if (token?.accessToken) {
      setAuthToken(token);
      console.log('Token:', token);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('There was an error!', error);
  }
}

fetchToken();
```

The policy parameter will be exapnded to SQL expresssion like below.

```sql

SELECT [all columns except `discount`] FROM sales_data
WHERE state in ('California', 'Nevada', 'Washington')

```

You can use connection-level policies along with row/column-level policies when your data needs both physical and logical isolation.
