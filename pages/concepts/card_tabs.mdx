# Card Tabs

In Semaphor, each visual is displayed in a frame. But you can display multiple cards in a single frame by using card tabs. You can think of Semaphor frames as a deck of cards where each card is a visual.

In the example below, we have a frame with two tabs `Month` and `Week`. The first tab shows orders by month and the second tab shows orders by week.

### Global Header

You can also add a global header to the cards in a frame. In the example below, we have added a KPI card to the frame with a name `All__Header` separated by double underscores.

Note that `All__Header` is special naming convention in Semaphor. It instructs Semaphor to display this KPI card as a header for all cards in the frame. When you accept changes, you will see that the KPI card is displayed as a header for all cards in the frame.

### Local Header

You can also define a local header for individual cards. Local headers are displayed only when you switch that specific tab. To name a local header, you follow the below naming convention:

Name of the tab + `__Header`. Note \_\_ is a double underscore.

For example, if your tab is named `Orders by Month`, the local header should be named `Orders by Month__Header`.

### KPI Card Info

Similar to visual cards, you can also add textual descriptions to KPI cards to provide additional context or explanation. This enhances the userâ€™s understanding of the data displayed on the KPI cards.

In the following example, we configure a KPI card alongside a descriptive text card:

- Monthly Orders (KPI Card Tab): Displays the primary key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Info: Serves as a description or explanatory text for the KPI card.

When you accept changes, you will see that the KPI card now has a `lightbulb` icon. Clicking on the icon will display the description card.
