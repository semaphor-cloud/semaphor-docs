# Card Tabs

In Semaphor, each visual is displayed in a frame. You can also display multiple cards in a single frame by using card tabs. You can think of Semaphor frames as a deck of cards where each card is a visual.

In the example below, we have a frame with two tabs `Month` and `Week`. The first tab shows orders by month and the second tab shows orders by week.

With this setup you can combine related insights into a single frame optimizing the dashboard layout.

### Global Header

You can add a global header to the frame that is displayed on all tabs. In the example below, we have added a KPI card to the frame and named it `All__Header` separated by double underscores.

Note that `All__Header` is a special naming convention. It indicates that Semaphor should display this KPI card as a header for all cards in the frame. When you accept changes, you will see that the KPI card is displayed as a header for all cards in the frame.

### Local Header

Similar to global headers, you can also define a local header for individual cards. Local headers are linked to specific tabs. To name a local header, you follow a similar naming convention:

Name of the tab + `__Header`. Note \_\_ is a double underscore.

For example, if your tab is named `Orders by Month`, the local header should be named `Orders by Month__Header`.

### KPI Card - Info text

Similar to visual cards, you can also add textual descriptions to KPI cards to provide additional context about the numbers. This enhances the userâ€™s understanding of the data displayed on the KPI cards.

In the following example, we configure a KPI card alongside a descriptive text card:

- Monthly Orders (KPI Card Tab): Displays the primary key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Info: Serves as a description or explanatory text for the KPI card.

When you accept changes, you will see that the KPI card now has a `lightbulb` icon. Clicking on the icon will display the description card.
