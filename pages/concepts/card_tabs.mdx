# Card Tabs

In Semaphor, each visual is displayed in a frame. You can also display multiple cards in a single frame by using card tabs. You can think of Semaphor frames as a deck of cards where each card is a visual.

In the example below, we have a frame with two tabs `Month` and `Week`. The first tab shows orders by month and the second tab shows orders by week.

With this setup you can combine related insights into a single frame optimizing the available space on the dashboard.

### Global Header

You can add a global header that appears above all tabs in a frame. This is useful for displaying important information that applies to all cards, like a summary KPI.

To create a global header:

1. Add a KPI card to the frame
2. Name it `All__Header` (using double underscores)

The example below shows a global header added to a frame with multiple tabs.

Note that `All__Header` is a special naming convention. It indicates that Semaphor should display this KPI card as a header for all cards in the frame. When you accept changes, you will see that the KPI card is displayed as a header for all cards in the frame.

### Local Header

In addition to global headers, you can also define a local header for individual cards. Local headers are linked to specific tabs and are displayed only when you switch that specific tab. To name a local header, you follow a similar naming convention:

Name of the tab + `__Header`. Note \_\_ is a double underscore.

If your tab is named `Orders by Month`, the local header should be named `Orders by Month__Header`.

### KPI Card - Info text

Similar to visual cards, you can also add textual descriptions to KPI cards to provide additional context about the numbers. This can be useful if you want to explain what the numbers mean or recommend actions.

In the example below, we have added a KPI card to the frame and named it `Orders by Month`. We have also added a local header named `Info`.

- Monthly Orders (KPI Card Tab): Displays the primary key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Info: Serves as a description or explanatory text for the KPI card.

When you accept changes, you will see that the KPI card now has a `lightbulb` button. Clicking on the button will display the info text.
